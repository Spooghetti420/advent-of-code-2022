# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions
Here are my solutions to the [Avent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles. So far it's day 1, and the puzzles are lovely fun and leisurely to boot :) What remains to see is just how fun they're gonna get!
Please don't look at the solutions to any problems you haven't already solved, if only because it would ruin your
own fun of solving them. But of course, if you want to use these if you get stuck, please feel welcome! :)

Merry Christmas!

## About
What is Advent of Code? It's an annual puzzle gauntlet laid out like an advent calendar, with challenges unlocking
with each day leading up to the 25th, and the goal is to collect all 50 stars. They're unlocked by clearing
the two stages made available on each day: one golden star fruit for beating the first part, and, once the second
has thusly been unlocked, you can get another one by beating the second part of the problem.
This year, it's said that the elves need 50 star fruit to snack on so that they can deliver all the presents. :)

The only problemâ€”that's all the stars there are! So, in order to feed the elves, we'll have to take the plunge and code as hard as we can. I'll be doing my best for the elves this year, and I hope you will as well!
Good luck to any fellow challengers. I don't know quite how complex of solutions lie in wait of us, but I'm ready at
any rate!

## Log
Here I'll keep track of all the days of the calendar until the very end. Stay tuned.

### Day 1
Today was quite nice. We were asked to inspect a list of calorie data, laid out in a text file,
with each elf in the group reporting every food item in their inventory by number of calories.
Each elf's inventory was then separated from the others by a newline; we then needed to add up each elf's totals
and find (in part 1) the #1 amount of calories that any elf has, and then in part 2, the top 3 amounts.
It turns out that everyone's input data is different, so we can't all share the same answers. :')
I must confess, I've thought of a much more elegant solution only after the fact, but this one is more
than sufficient for what's been asked of us.
